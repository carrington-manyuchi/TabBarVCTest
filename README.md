I gave learners task to create the tabBar and Card programmattically.
They key take away points here were to use:
- Core Graphics
- Programmatic UIKit
- Use Scene Delegate in creating root controller
- Use Tab Bar VC
- Responsive UIKit
- Setting up constraints programmatically
- Custom Colors
- etc..
